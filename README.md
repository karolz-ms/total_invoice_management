# total_invoice_managment
### *a Kubernetes tutorial*

Original repo accompanies a [blog post](https://medium.com/@MostlyHarmlessD/getting-started-with-microservices-and-kubernetes-76354312b556). 
This repo contains a modified version that uses Helm for deployment and sends diagnostic data to Application Insights.
One should create an Application Insights resource and have its instrumentation key ready before attempting to deploy the app.

## Configure deployment environment

### Minikube
If using minikube, switch to the built-in Docker daemon:
```
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```
(this affects the current shell only).

Pull latest fluentd sidecar image for sending logs to Application Insights
```
docker pull atcdemo.azurecr.io/fluentdsidecar:latest
```

### AKS
If you are deploying to AKS, it's by default RBAC dsiabled. You can remove all RBAC related settings before deployment.  
If you created an AKS cluster with RBAC enabled, you need to install tiller following the commands below. [Here](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/rbac.md) is more detailed documentation. Otherwise, tiller won't be able to talk to the K8s API server.
```
kubectl delete svc tiller-deploy -n kube-system
kubectl -n kube-system delete deploy tiller-deploy
kubectl create serviceaccount --namespace kube-system tiller
kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-cluster-rule --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller
helm init --service-account tiller
helm ls # does not return an error
```

## Build Docker images

```
docker build . -f invoices_svc/Dockerfile -t invoices_svc:v1
docker build . -f expected_date_svc/Dockerfile -t expected_date_svc:v1
docker build . -f auth_svc/Dockerfile -t auth_svc:v1
docker build . -f entry_svc/Dockerfile -t entry_svc:v1
```

## Deploy
```
cd ./kube
helm install total_invoice --name total-invoice-rel  --set 'appinsights_instrumentationkey=<YOUR APP INSIGHS IKEY>'
```

NOTICE: Make sure the values are set correctly in values.yaml.  
For example, the default Kubernetes namespace to deploy into is `total-invoice`.
If a different namespace is desired, override the "namespace" value (pass `--set 'namespace=other-namespace'` to `helm install`).  
Also make sure the images are pushed to the registry and can be pulled from your cluster.

## To learn what the entry URL is
```
 minikube service entry-svc --url --namespace total-invoice
```

## To interrogate the invoices service
```
curl http://<ENTRY SERVICE URL>/invoices/14 -H 'authorization: letmeinpleasekthxbye'
```
(replace entry service URL as necessary).

## To delete the deployment
```
helm del --purge total-invoice-rel
```
